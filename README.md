# oneweekcode

Hey Welcome to my Project!! I'm Gabriel Fernandes and I made this project during a week of learning.

The Project is Basically a Responsive Local Pub's Finder, using API's to locate Bars abroad some area already set, and to get different photos using "LEAFLET",
an open-source JavaScript library, 
for mobile-friendly interactive maps;  and "UNSPLASH" just to get some pretty illustrative Pubs Photos;


Project Web Pages:

-Welcome Screen
-Main Map Screen (buttons: Pub Icon and New Pub Icon)
-Selected Pub Screen (Pub's Informations)
-New Pub Screen (Singning up a new Pub)




Unfortunatelly I didn't record the site running BUT I found a guy who probably had studied this OneWeekCode and the functionalites
that he is using are the same I used, and here is the video :)

Well that's it, I hope you found interesting and
Thank you for your time!!
